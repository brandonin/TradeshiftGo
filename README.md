Take Home exam for Tradeshift Go

Steps to reproduce Test:

```npm install```

```npm run test```


Things I would have improved on if I had more time:
* Add more styling to make it look nice.
* Create three different columns for the input
* Create a button that would change the transition. Currently the way it works in on text change.
* Change the transitions so that it makes a little bit more sense, but I would have used another library for this.
* Upgrade the tests to have end to end tests rather than just unit tests.
* Create logic for different triangles like obtuse, acute and right angle.
* Make the css relate further to what type of triangle it is.

INSTRUCTIONS

Please create a view that will contain 3 inputs which
will represent a side of a triangle. Once the inputs
have been completed, please do the following:
* Determine what type of triangle the inputs will create. (i.e equilateral etc)
* Draw the triangle with css
* Bonus points if you animate the triangle changing size based on inputs!
Once the above is complete, please write unit tests for your code. You may remove the instructions for more screen space.
